##Problem Set

/_ Problem 1:-
Write a program that prints:
Welcome to Java Programming 🚀
Use the main method and correct syntax.
_/

/_ Problem 2:-
Declare a variable of type double for temperature in Celsius.
Convert it to Fahrenheit using the formula:
F = (C × 9/5) + 32
Print the result with labels.
_/

/_ Problem 3:-
Declare two variables of type int for length and breadth.
Calculate and print the area and perimeter of the rectangle.
_/

/_ Problem 4:-
Declare one variable of each primitive data type:
byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean.
Print their default values using a single System.out.println() per variable.
_/

/_ Problem 5:-
Create a String variable for first name and another for last name.
Concatenate them and print the full name using a message:
Full Name: [Your Full Name]
_/

/_ Problem 6:-
Create a program that:
• Takes a double value of 99.99
• Casts it to an int
• Then stores it in a long and adds 10000
• Prints all 3 values with labels
Add comments to explain the behavior during casting and conversion.
_/

/_ Problem 7:-
Declare four int variables: a, b, c, d.
Assign values and compute this expression:
result = a _ b + c / d - (a + d) % b
Print the result and show each step using intermediate variables.
\*/

/_ Problem 8:-
Write a program that:
• Creates a String object with value "Java"
• Creates another String using new String("Java")
• Compares them using == and .equals()
• Prints clear output showing the difference in results
_/

/_ Problem 9:-
Create a constant named GST_RATE = 0.18.
Given a product price and quantity as input, compute:
• Net price
• GST

Use appropriate data types and constants.
_/

/_ Problem 10:-
Create a program that:
• Stores the maximum and minimum values of int, byte, float, and double
using wrapper class constants (e.g., Integer.MAX_VALUE)
• Print each value with a proper label and formatting
