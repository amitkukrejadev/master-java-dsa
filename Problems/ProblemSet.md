##Problem Set

/* Problem 1:-
Write a program that prints:
Welcome to Java Programming ðŸš€
Use the main method and correct syntax.
*/

/* Problem 2:-
Declare a variable of type double for temperature in Celsius.
Convert it to Fahrenheit using the formula:
F = (C Ã— 9/5) + 32
Print the result with labels.
*/

/* Problem 3:-
Declare two variables of type int for length and breadth.
Calculate and print the area and perimeter of the rectangle.
*/

/* Problem 4:-
Declare one variable of each primitive data type:
byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean.
Print their default values using a single System.out.println() per variable.
*/

/* Problem 5:-
Create a String variable for first name and another for last name.
Concatenate them and print the full name using a message:
Full Name: [Your Full Name]
*/

/* Problem 6:-
Create a program that:
  â€¢ Takes a double value of 99.99
  â€¢ Casts it to an int
  â€¢ Then stores it in a long and adds 10000
  â€¢ Prints all 3 values with labels
Add comments to explain the behavior during casting and conversion.
*/

/* Problem 7:-
Declare four int variables: a, b, c, d.
Assign values and compute this expression:
result = a * b + c / d - (a + d) % b
Print the result and show each step using intermediate variables.
*/

/* Problem 8:-
Write a program that:
  â€¢ Creates a String object with value "Java"
  â€¢ Creates another String using new String("Java")
  â€¢ Compares them using == and .equals()
  â€¢ Prints clear output showing the difference in results
*/

/* Problem 9:-
Create a constant named GST_RATE = 0.18.
Given a product price and quantity as input, compute:
  â€¢ Net price
  â€¢ GST
  â€¢ Total payable
Use appropriate data types and constants.
*/

/* Problem 10:-
Create a program that:
  â€¢ Stores the maximum and minimum values of int, byte, float, and double
    using wrapper class constants (e.g., Integer.MAX_VALUE)
  â€¢ Print each value with a proper label and formatting
